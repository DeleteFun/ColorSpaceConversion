\section{Overview of Color Spaces}

For the purposes of this project, a color space dedicated to human skin is necessary. When it comes to pattern recognition, it is beneficial to reduce the number of channels which the algorithm must process, as well as reducing the information density in those channels. It is also hoped that, in an appropriate color space, it will be a simple matter to separate the characteristics associated with saturation of tissue with blood, which changes under mechanical stress from the unchanging pigmentation of the cells (\cite{Stamatas2004}). Color spaces --- when they are normally defined --- are a combination of rotations, scaling and translations, while some (e.g. HSV (\cite{Vezhnevets2003, Zarit1999a} )) also perform a coordinate transform. The color space defined for this project is unusual in that it uses a non-linear redistribution of the values. It should be noted that this is not a pixel-based classifier (\cite{Jones2002}). However, seeing as the color space contains both the statistical information and the skin color information, it can be interpreted in a probabilistic way.

For the sake of comparison, the following four color spaces --- all of which have been used for skin detection (\cite{Vezhnevets2003,Zarit1999a,Yang1997a,Brand2000a,Sigal2000a,Chai2000a,Phung2002a}) --- have been evaluated for the purposes of this project.

\subsection{LAB}\label{sec:LAB}

The LAB color space's perceptual uniformity makes it well-suited for skin detection, as the human eye can perceive practically any change in its values (\cite{Vezhnevets2003,Poynton1997}). However, the Gaussian distribution of the skin is not positioned on the axis, which makes applying the statistics troublesome.

\subsection{RGB}\label{sec:RGB}

The RGB color space, while widely used, is perhaps the most ill-suited color space for skin detection, as it can't make a distinction between chrominance and luminance, as discussed by ~\cite{Vezhnevets2003,Brand2000a}. That said, its ubiquity in cameras --- which are designed to capture images which, to us, appear to be an accurate representation of physical reality despite the opposite being true --- makes it a necessary color space to work in. The advantage to using it is simply the fact that it is a straightforward, raw output from the camera.

\subsection{HSV}\label{sec:HSV}

Unlike RGB, the HSV color space makes a clear distinction between the chrominance (the "Hue" and "Saturation" channels) and the luminance (the "Value" channel), storing them separately (\cite{Vezhnevets2003,Sigal2000a}). This makes HSV a popular choice for skin segmentation, but it's difficult to control any information loss during the transform due to its non-linearity (\cite{Poynton1997}).

\subsection{YCbCr}\label{sec:YCbCr}

This color space bears similarities to the LAB and HSV spaces in that it explicitly separates the chrominance and the luminance. The luminosity (or "luma") channel "Y" is a weighted sum of the RGB values (\cite{Poynton1997,Phung2002a}), while the chrominance channels "Cb" and "Cr" contain the color difference between Y and the red and blue components of RGB, respectively (\cite{Vezhnevets2003}). Also like LAB, it is not oriented such that the Gaussian distribution is situated along the axis. In fact, there is little distinction between the two spaces aside from the orientation in the chromatic portion of the space.

The main issue with using these color spaces is the lack of control over information flow upon transformation and the clear mathematical statement of the transformation in terms of rotation, scaling and translation. Therefore, the construction of a new color space is necessary.

\section{Constructing a New Color Space}\label{sec:ConstructingANewColorSpace}

In order to construct a new color space, we need to consider the coordinate system of the new color space, the orientation of the new color space, and the fidelity of the discrete representation of the axes.

The first consideration is most easily decided; because there's little obvious advantage otherwise, we choose a Cartesean coordinate system as this allows for a straightforward transformation involving only rotation, translation and scaling. Because we're interested in the color information in the image, it's useful to design the color space so there is a luminosity axis. This choice determines two of three rotational degrees of freedom, as will be discussed below.

As for the discrete representation of the axes, it's desired that all the information captured pertaining to a hand should be preserved; all other information is irrelevant. However, here we'll consider only the effect of a rotation and scaling on the discrete representation.


\subsection{Camera RGB and Normalization for Discrete Range}\label{sec:CameraRGB}

Due to the hardware being locked down at the application level, we do not have access to the raw camera feed. We do, however, have access to the compressed, post-processing 8-bit RGB image data. The processing involves evening up the color channel senors' sensitivity by way of multiplying each channel by an appropriate correction factor. This is partly why cameras likely have a 10 or 12 bit/channel capture rate, but after accounting for differences in sensitivity, it only outputs in 8-bit color depth.

The three-color RGB channel sensors commonly found in CCD cameras are based on how the human eye perceives colors. But in physical reality, light is actually hitting the camera as a continuous spectrum. Since it's impossible to map an infinite set of Gaussians to it, we instead use some function which, for any frequency, will give the intensity of the light hitting the point at that frequency. This function is expanded in the basis set of three Gaussians with mean values centered on the RGB frequencies. This model is used in cameras because the main purpose of cameras -- until recent times -- has been to capture images for human viewing. And while the RGB Gaussian basis model is perfectly suited for capturing all the scene information which humans can perceive, it is not a complete representation.

Because we're searching for particular points in the real color space -- which, being a continuous function, is infinite dimensional -- there is a possibility in the future that larger multi-channel color spaces will be much more common, such as the 8-channel color spaces currently in development. Though most such cameras are primarily designed for post-production editing for still pictures and film (e.g. changing the lighting independent of the scene), as well as visual effects, the possibilities for computer vision are exciting. However, computer vision tasks are computationally intensive, and more often than not require operation in real time, so there is a natural inclination to shy away from large data sets in practical computer vision applications; many tasks are done in grayscale or single channel processing to expedite the process.

As such, there is a need to develop techniques which keep the relevant information while quickly and efficiently discarding the irrelevant information. This is true for the RGB space at the moment, and the aim of this first part of the work.


\subsection{Rotation Matrix}\label{sec:RotationMatrix}

Any rotation about an axis can be represented by a matrix. Such rotations can be expressed as a 3x3 square matrix in a 3D space. Since they are generally invertible, they're guaranteed to be non-singular. For this application, we require rotation about three different axes, which can be expressed thus:


\begin{alignat}{1}
R_x(\theta) &= \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & \cos \theta &  -\sin \theta \\[3pt]
0 & \sin \theta  &  \cos \theta \\[3pt]
\end{bmatrix} \\[6pt]
R_y(\theta) &= \begin{bmatrix}
\cos \theta & 0 & \sin \theta \\[3pt]
0 & 1 & 0 \\[3pt]
-\sin \theta & 0 & \cos \theta \\
\end{bmatrix} \\[6pt]
R_z(\theta) &= \begin{bmatrix}
\cos \theta &  -\sin \theta & 0 \\[3pt]
\sin \theta & \cos \theta & 0\\[3pt]
0 & 0 & 1\\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{alignat}


It should be noted that the solutions are not unique; there are many ways in which to rotate an object from one position to another, or use a combination of different rotations to get to the same point, so they aren't necessarily unique, but this has no bearing on this project. So any rotation which orients the RGB color space such that one of the new axes lies along the luminosity direction is sufficient. To achieve this end using rotations about the RGB color space axes requires a rotation in only two of those axes.

A rotation which aligns the X axis along the luminosity direction is produced by a rotation of $\frac{\pi}4$ about the Y axis, followed by a rotation of $\arctan{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}}$ about the Z axis. This leaves one free rotational degree of freedom about the X axis. The resulting rotation matrix is given by:

\begin{equation}
R_{xyz}(\theta) =
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
 \frac{1}{3} & \frac{1}{3} & \frac{1}{3} \\
 -\frac{\cos (\theta )}{2}-\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{3} \sin (\theta ) & \cos (\theta ) & \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{3} \sin (\theta )-\frac{\cos (\theta )}{2} \\
 \frac{\sin (\theta )}{2}-\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{3} \cos (\theta ) & -\sin (\theta ) & \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{3} \cos (\theta )+\frac{\sin (\theta )}{2} \\
\end{array}
\right)
\end{equation}


Where $\theta$ is the remaining rotational degree of freedom.

Using the standard rotation matrices, we get a luminosity axis from 0 to $\sqrt{3}$. However, the length of the two remaining axes are dependent on the value of $\theta$ used. This is a problem because, ultimately, we want the axes to fit in a range of an appropriate data type. It would be more useful to have a matrix which provided the specified rotation and scaled the axis to known lengths. In the case of the luminosity, this is straightforward; simply divide by $\sqrt{3}$. In the case of the other two axes, we need an explicit form for the lengths of the axis resulting from the rotation.

Because the absolute values of the axes in the color space have no meaning, we're only interested in the position along the axis relative to its start and end, equivalent to talking about the position in the axis relative to $0:1$, compared to about 0-255 in unsigned, 8-bit integers. The upside is that if we're rotating the cube about its corner, we're interested in the minimum and maximum values possible along the new axis direction, which will correspond to a corner of the RGB cube. With the X axis aligned along the luminosity direction, the range of the X axis is 0 to $\sqrt{3}$. The Y and Z axes are symmetrical, spanning a range centered on 0. The range of their values is dependent upon the remaining degree of freedom.

We need to know, in each of the axes, how far out each point is. Because we're effectively rotating a hexagon, whatever the answer is, we know the function is going to be periodic, repeating every $\frac{\pi}{3}$ radians, so we only have to solve it in the 0 to $\frac{\pi}{3}$ region and then generalize. First we take the cooordinates of the RGB cube and perform the rotation to find the values in the new color space.


\begin{multline}\label{eq:YabCube}
  R_{xyz}(\theta)\cdot\left(
\begin{array}{cccccccc}
 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
\end{array}
\right) = \\
\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{%
$\displaystyle
\left(
\begin{array}{cccccccc}
 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} & \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} & \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} & \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} & \sqrt{3} \\
 0 & -\frac{\cos (\theta)}{\sqrt{6}}-\frac{\sin (\theta)}{\sqrt{2}} & \frac{\cos (\theta)}{\sqrt{6}}-\frac{\sin (\theta)}{\sqrt{2}} & \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \cos (\theta) & \frac{\cos (\theta)}{\sqrt{6}}+\frac{\sin (\theta)}{\sqrt{2}} & \frac{\sin (\theta)}{\sqrt{2}}-\frac{\cos (\theta)}{\sqrt{6}} & -\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \cos (\theta) & 0 \\
 0 & \frac{\sin (\theta)}{\sqrt{6}}-\frac{\cos (\theta)}{\sqrt{2}} & -\frac{\cos (\theta)}{\sqrt{2}}-\frac{\sin (\theta)}{\sqrt{6}} & -\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \sin (\theta) & \frac{\cos (\theta)}{\sqrt{2}}-\frac{\sin (\theta)}{\sqrt{6}} & \frac{\cos (\theta)}{\sqrt{2}}+\frac{\sin (\theta)}{\sqrt{6}} & \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \sin (\theta) & 0 \\
\end{array}
\right)$}
\end{multline}


The extent of the new axis is found by taking the maximum and minimum values of each row i.e. the extreme corner positions relative to each new axis. An additional symmetry of the hexagonal projection of the RGB cube allows us to say that whatever functional form is taken by one of the $\theta$ dependant ranges the other can be found by a simple phase shift. So recognising that the minimum value is simply $-1$ times the maximum we have simplified the problem to solving

\begin{equation}\label{eq:AxisRangeMinMax}
 \max\left(\pm\frac{\sin (\theta )}{\sqrt{6}}\pm\frac{\cos (\theta )}{\sqrt{2}}, \pm\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \sin (\theta ) \right) \quad \text{Where} \quad 0\leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{3}
\end{equation}

Graphically, the problem appears as follows:

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \caption{Evaluation of the color space problem.}\label{fig:YABCubeEval}
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Chapter2/Figs/YABCubeEval.eps}
\end{figure}

In the range 0 to $\frac{\pi}{3}$, both sin and cos are positive, therefore the axis ranges are given by the following:


\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
  \hline
  % after \\: \hline or \cline{col1-col2} \cline{col3-col4} ...
    & Min & Max \\ \hline
  X & \(0\) & \(\sqrt{3}\) \\
  Y & \(-\frac{\sin \left((\left(\theta -\frac{\pi }{6}\right) \bmod \frac{\pi }{3})\right)}{\sqrt{6}}-\frac{\cos \left((\left(\theta -\frac{\pi }{6}\right) \bmod \frac{\pi }{3})\right)}{\sqrt{2}}\) & \(\frac{\sin \left((\left(\theta -\frac{\pi }{6}\right) \bmod \frac{\pi }{3})\right)}{\sqrt{6}}+\frac{\cos \left((\left(\theta -\frac{\pi }{6}\right) \bmod \frac{\pi }{3})\right)}{\sqrt{2}}\) \\
  Z & \(-\frac{\sin \left((\theta  \bmod \frac{\pi }{3})\right)}{\sqrt{6}}-\frac{\cos \left((\theta  \bmod \frac{\pi }{3})\right)}{\sqrt{2}} \) & \(\frac{\sin \left((\theta  \bmod \frac{\pi }{3})\right)}{\sqrt{6}}+\frac{\cos \left((\theta  \bmod \frac{\pi }{3})\right)}{\sqrt{2}}\) \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}


It is convenient to produce a transformation which will result in axes of known length. Because the rotation cannot include a translation, we desire a transformation matrix which will result in the ranges $0:1$, -$\frac{1}2$ to $\frac{1}2$, and -$\frac{1}2$ to $\frac{1}2$. Such a transformation is easily obtained by multiplying the rotation matrix by a diagonal matrix with the reciprocal of the maximums found above placed along the diagonal. This will scale each axis to a unit length.

The normalized rotation matrix is given by:
\begin{gather*}
  \widetilde{\theta} = \theta  \bmod \frac{\pi }{3} \\
\widetilde{\vartheta} = \left(\theta +\frac{\pi }{6}\right) \bmod \frac{\pi }{3}
\end{gather*}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:NormRxyz}
\overline{R}_{xyz}(\theta) =
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
 \frac{1}{3} & \frac{1}{3} & \frac{1}{3} \\
 -\frac{\sqrt{3} \cos (\theta )+3 \sin (\theta )}{3 \cos \left(\widetilde{\vartheta}\right)+\sqrt{3} \sin \left(\widetilde{\vartheta}\right)} & \frac{2 \sqrt{3} \cos (\theta )}{3 \cos \left(\widetilde{\vartheta}\right)+\sqrt{3} \sin \left(\widetilde{\vartheta}\right)} & \frac{3 \sin (\theta )-\sqrt{3} \cos (\theta )}{3 \cos \left(\widetilde{\vartheta}\right)+\sqrt{3} \sin \left(\widetilde{\vartheta}\right)} \\
 \frac{\sqrt{3} \sin (\theta )-3 \cos (\theta )}{3 \cos \left(\widetilde{\theta}\right)+\sqrt{3} \sin \left(\widetilde{\theta}\right)} & -\frac{2 \sqrt{3} \sin (\theta )}{3 \cos \left(\widetilde{\theta}\right)+\sqrt{3} \sin \left(\widetilde{\theta}\right)} & \frac{3 \cos (\theta )+\sqrt{3} \sin (\theta )}{3 \cos \left(\widetilde{\theta}\right)+\sqrt{3} \sin \left(\widetilde{\theta}\right)} \\
\end{array}
\right)
\end{equation}

\section{Skin Statistics}\label{sec:SkinStatistics}

In order to identify the range of values for the skin space, a large number of skin samples were taken from photographs from the Humane project by Angelica Dass, an ongoing "chromatic inventory" art project which aims to compile every possible human skin color, categorized by the PANTONE guide color classification system. The skin colors catalogued thus far are independent of race or ethnicity, so the samples are representative of human skin tones in general.

The image set consists of approximately 200 skin samples --- each of which shows only skin --- which are placed in a single directory in the file system. In accordance to our assumption that luminosity is not a significant factor in our skin model, we then perform the transformation initially with the value of $\theta$ equal to 0. The Matlab code collects frequency data for the rotated color space, incrementing the counts of a three-dimensional array of bins which span the color space. Viewing the frequency data along each of the three axes reveals that the skin image characteristics are spread widely in luminosity, but are quite confined in hue and saturation as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:InitBins}.


\begin{figure}[h!]
  \caption{Initial set of bins.}\label{fig:InitBins}
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Chapter2/Figs/InitialBins.eps}
\end{figure}


Aside from differing lighting, this is consistent with the notion that skin has a distinct pigmentation and justifies our attempt to find an appropriate color space disregarding luminosity. In doing so, the distribution of the skin color characteristics neatly fit into a 2-dimensional Gaussian distribution. The Matlab code produces a fit with a 2-dimensional Gaussian distribution and provides an angle relative to the orientation of the Gaussian fit to the skin sample distribution in the current color space. 

Given that we are free to choose the orientation of the color space about the luminosity axis, the Matlab code allows us to find an orientation $\theta$ of the color space about the luminosity axis in which the distribution can be expressed as a product of 1-dimensional Gaussians along the axes. The final resulting distribution is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:DistributionAndGaussianFit}.


\begin{figure}[h!]
  \caption{Distribution and Gaussian fit to the chromatic pixel values in the new color space.}
  \label{fig:DistributionAndGaussianFit}
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Chapter2/Figs/crosshairFigureFinal.eps}
\end{figure}


For numerical reasons, the value for $\theta$ was found iteratively by performing the color space transformation and the statistical fit until the value for $\theta$ converged. (See Figure~\ref{fig:ConvergenceTheta}.)


\begin{figure}[h!]
  \caption{Convergence of color space orientation $\theta$.}

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Chapter2/Figs/ConvergenceOfSkinSpaceFinal.eps}
\end{figure}


\section{Preservation of Color Information}\label{sec:PreservationOfColorInformation}

The goal of the algorithm is to preserve all the information captured by the camera which relates to skin whilst discarding as much of the irrelevant information as possible. Given that edges and features often present as shadows and highlights, all the information captured in terms of luminosity will be regarded as relevant information, at least as far as the manipulation of individual pixel values is concerned. Considering the chromatic information, the importance of the pixel value will be directly determined by the Gaussian distribution found previously.

Knowing the range of values produced by the rotation allows us to scale the transformation to fit into the range of destination data type. If we have RGB pixel values in a given machine data type, the amount of information contained in each of those channels is equal to the number of values accessible in that data type. For example: for 8-bit, unsigned integers, there are 256 possible values. After a rotation, we are interested in the amount of information which lies along the new axes. This is found simply by multiplying the range of the source data type by the length of the new axes found for the unit cube. To preserve all the information captured, we would therefore have to use a larger data type to store the new values. We are, however, only interested in a small region in the chromatic space, at least. The question is, then, how to preserve the relevant information in a way consistent with the significance indicated by the Gaussian distribution found previously.





\begin{figure}[h!]
  \caption{Unit graph.}
  \label{fig:UnitGraph}
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Chapter2/Figs/unitGraph.eps}
\end{figure}


None of the rotated axes have lengths less than 1 for the unit RGB cube. For this reason we've written redistribution functions which perform any necessary type conversion whilst preserving the information in a controlled way; we can keep the information where it's needed and discard it where it's irrelevant. So although this is strictly beyond the normal meaning of a color space conversion, it is addressing a connected issue and belongs in the conversion. In terms of optimisation, it is also the most efficient place in the code in which to perform this adjustment, allowing us to --- for the sake of example --- discard the details of the colors of a duck's feathers whilst keeping the hues and tones of human skin.

We can use a function to redistribute the information contained on the longer axis onto the shorter axis, which can be expressed in the discrete representation of that axis necessitated by internal integer data types. There are three ways in which to implement the redistribution functions:

\subsection{Partition}\label{sec:Partition}

The most straightforward redistribution method is to simply preserve the information in a 1-to-1 fashion within a region. The region can be defined in terms of the skin color distribution Gaussian by specifying a significance level in terms of the variance or the standard deviation.

\subsection{Linear}\label{sec:Linear}

A slightly more sophisticated method is to use a linear redistribution. A linear distribution is equivalent to partitioning given a unit gradient. However, a linear redistribution function allows for the possibility of data compression. So then, in the case where the region of interest contains more information than can be expressed in the destination data type, a linear distribution function allows an even compression of the information from source to destination.

\subsection{ERF (Gaussian Error Function)}\label{sec:ERF}

The integral of the cumulative Gaussian (i.e. Error Function) allows the redistribution of the information on the axis in a way which selectively preserves the information about a point on the axis (i.e. the mean of the Gaussian), and then progressively discard the information as it falls into the tails of the Gaussian. So, it provides a non-linear distribution of the information. The Gaussian can be seen as describing our interest in the information contained along the axis, so it's logical to use the error function to redistribute the information. The disadvantage of this is simply the computational effort involved in generating the error function.

The error function distribution is mathematically correct, being directly related to the Gaussian fit. Computationally, there are two considerations: the numerical representation, and performance. The discrete representation of the numerics means that --- for a significant number of possible distributions --- distributing using the error function has little to no advantage (or indeed difference) from using a linear distribution.

Considering the preservation of information captured, mappings with a gradient greater than 1 are undesirable because they preserve all the information whilst being informatically wasteful in that there are functionally inaccessible discrete values in the destination range. Our stated aim is to preserve the information in the image pertaining to human skin; unevenly distributing this information across a discrete data type is not only wasteful in terms of memory, but also of processing resources because subsequent processing routines will treat the data as if it has a higher fidelity than it actually does.

To construct a distribution function, we first need to describe the relationship of the error function to the Gaussian fit, and then produce a function with the appropriate range and domain. For a Gaussian fit with an amplitude A, a mean of $\mu$, and a standard deviation of $\sigma$, where $\mu$ and x lie in a source range sMin to sMax. The cumulative distribution is found by integrating from sMin to the point x, as can be seen in (\ref{eq:ErfDefinition}):

\begin{equation}\label{eq:ErfDefinition}
  \int _{\text{sMin}}^{\text{x}} A \frac{e^{-\frac{(t-\mu )^2}{2 \sigma ^2}}}{\sqrt{2 \pi } \sigma }dt=\frac{1}{2} A \left(\text{erf}\left(\frac{\text{x}-\mu }{\sqrt{2} \sigma }\right)-\text{erf}\left(\frac{\text{sMin}-\mu }{\sqrt{2} \sigma }\right)\right)
\end{equation}

The Gaussian distribution and the cumulative distribution are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ErrorFunctionGraph} for some values chosen for illustrative purposes. All that is required now is to fix the range dMin to dMax for the domain sMin to sMax.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \caption{Error function.}
  \label{fig:ErrorFunctionGraph}
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Chapter2/Figs/errorFunction.eps}
\end{figure}

First, we determine the maximum value taken in the domain. This is simply found by evaluating the function at sMax. It should be noted that --- if the Gaussian distribution is well-contained in the source domain --- the maximum value should be equal to the amplitude. For the sake of simplicity, we'll ignore the amplitude of the fitted Gaussian found previously as it is not relevant to the design of the redistribution function. So, to fix the range of the distribution function, we first scale to the range $0:1$ by simply dividing through by the maximum value, and then re-scale to the destination range dMax - dMin and shift by dMin.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:disFunction}
  dis(x) = \frac{(\text{dMax}-\text{dMin}) \left(\text{erf}\left(\frac{x-\mu }{\sqrt{2} \sigma }\right)-\text{erf}\left(\frac{\text{sMin}-\mu }{\sqrt{2} \sigma }\right)\right)}{\text{erf}\left(\frac{\text{sMax}-\mu }{\sqrt{2} \sigma }\right)-\text{erf}\left(\frac{\text{sMin}-\mu }{\sqrt{2} \sigma }\right)}+\text{dMin}
\end{equation}

Mathematically, this distribution function~(\ref{eq:disFunction}) achieves all the stated objectives. However, on a device we are dealing with discrete numerics and limited processing power, so further analysis is required. Where we're using a discrete domain and range, the distribution is usefully divided into three characteristic behaviors:  where it is constant, where it preserves all the information, and where it selectively preserves information. Looking at the distribution, this divides the source domain into five regions: two where it is effectively constant, two where it is selective, and one region around the mean where it preserves all the information. In order to design an efficient algorithm, it is useful to identify the boundaries of these five regions.

First, we need to identify where the distribution is effectively constant. This can be found by solving the following equation in the region and domain $0 \le x \le 1$ and then generalized to the specific discrete numerics:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:0to1}
 \frac{\text{erf}\left(\frac{\mu }{\sqrt{2} \sigma }\right)+\text{erf}\left(\frac{x-\mu }{\sqrt{2} \sigma }\right)}{\text{erf}\left(\frac{\mu }{\sqrt{2} \sigma }\right)-\text{erf}\left(\frac{\mu -1}{\sqrt{2} \sigma }\right)}=\text{dL} \quad \text{where} \quad \text{dL} = \left\{ \frac{1}{\text{dMax} - \text{dMin}}, 1 - \frac{1}{\text{dMax} - \text{dMin}} \right\}
\end{equation}


The solution is found for the source domain in the range $0:1$ as:


\begin{equation}\label{eq:LowHigh}
 x = \sqrt{2} \sigma  \text{erf}^{-1}\left((\text{dL}-1) \text{erf}\left(\frac{\mu }{\sqrt{2} \sigma }\right)-\text{dL} \; \text{erf}\left(\frac{\mu -1}{\sqrt{2} \sigma }\right)\right)+\mu
\end{equation}

To find the region where all the information in the source domain is preserved, we differentiate the distribution and solve for where the gradient is equal to the destination range over the source range. This corresponds to the point at which a unit change in the source produces a unit change in the destination range:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:Boundaries}
\frac{2 \sigma e^{-\sigma^2 (\mu-x)^2}}{\sqrt{\pi } (\text{erf}(\mu \sigma)+\text{erf}(\sigma-\mu \sigma))}=\frac{\text{dMax - dMin}}{\text{sMax - sMin}}
\end{equation}

Rearranging for x, we find:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:PreservedRegion}
 x=\mu -\sigma  \sqrt{2 \log \left( \frac{\text{dMax - dMin}}{\text{sMax - sMin}} \frac{1}{ \sigma  \left(\text{erf}\left(\frac{\mu }{\sqrt{2} \sigma }\right)-\text{erf}\left(\frac{\mu -1}{\sqrt{2} \sigma }\right)\right)}\right)+\log \left(\frac{2}{\pi }\right)}
\end{equation}

We now have an equation that gives us the four points in the source domain which mark the boundaries of the five characteristic regions. The equations are valid in the unit source domain $0:1$. It is a simple matter to scale and shift these values to give the points in a more general source domain.

There is one final value of interest to the development of the algorithm, which is the gradient at the mean. The reason this is of interest is because we're trying to compress the relevant data as much as possible. If the destination region is small (i.e. the destination machine type is smaller than the source type), then the gradient at the mean allows us to assess the fidelity required of the source type. If it weren't for the fact that the source is the result of a rotation transformation, then there would be little purpose in assessing this value. However, it is entirely possible that the lengthening of the axes resulting from the rotation is insignificant for the desired destination type; there's no point preserving information during the rotation which is then discarded by the redistribution. The gradient for a unit source and domain is given by

\begin{equation}
\Delta = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi }}}{\sigma  \left(\text{erf}\left(\frac{\mu }{\sqrt{2} \sigma }\right)-\text{erf}\left(\frac{\mu -1}{\sqrt{2} \sigma }\right)\right)}
\end{equation}

therefore the required fidelity in the source domain is given by $\Delta$ in the sense that the correspondence between one information step in the source must produce a step of $\Delta$ in the destination type. For the algorithm it is useful to know the length of the source domain axis which would cover the destination range if a linear distribution with a gradient $\Delta$ were to be used. For a unit range this length is given by $\frac{1}{\Delta}$ which is a function of the mean and standard deviation

\begin{equation}\label{Fidelity}
  \Lambda(\mu,\sigma) =  \sqrt{\frac{\pi }{2}} \sigma  \left(\text{erf}\left(\frac{\mu }{\sqrt{2} \sigma }\right)-\text{erf}\left(\frac{\mu -1}{\sqrt{2} \sigma }\right)\right)
\end{equation}

\section{The Skin Color Space Algorithm}

Now that all of the values necessary to preserve the skin information have been obtained, we can use them to build a color space transformation algorithm which can make intelligent decisions about the numerical precision for the intermediate and final variables, as well as determining the most efficient transformation methods. The algorithm described herein will take values of $\theta$, the rotation about the luminosity axis, the standard deviations and mean values for the two chromatic axes, and will automatically decide upon the necessary intermediate working data types and the most efficient redistribution methods.

Previously, we found the lengths of the new axes after the rotational transformation. If we were to keep the same data type for the color space as is used for the RGB values, then the axes would have to be rescaled with the accompanying loss of information. Given that we have values which allow us to assess where all the relevant information lies, a more sophisticated approach is possible. For a chromatic axis --- which, after rotation, has a length $L(\theta)$ --- we can determine the positions on that axis at which the information is considered irrelevant using Equation~(\ref{eq:LowHigh}). If the distance between these two points is less than or equal to 1, then all the relevant information can be retained for that axis in the same data type as was used for the RGB color space. The only further consideration is to ensure that the values outside that range are prevented from causing errors associated with overflow. To exclude this possibility, a conditional statement can be used which checks the bounds as stated, assigning an appropriate value as necessary. The alternative is to use an intermediate value with a higher bit depth, and then to recast into the destination data type in such a way that overflow and underflow are handled appropriately. The OpenCV library provides a casting method --- "saturateCast" --- which serves this purpose.

We need to consider the requested compression of information alongside the spread of information caused by the rotation, and the desired focus on the specific region of interest dictated by the statistics. Each axis in the color space is to be represented by a discrete set of numbers. The size of these sets dictates the discretization of the axis, and the ratios between them indicates the spread or compression of the information they contain. We assume that the RGB axes are each discretized to the same extent, each containing $\text{rgbRange}$ values. After the application of the un-normalized rotational transformation, the axes contain differing numbers of values given by $\text{sRange}_1 =\text{rgbRange} \sqrt{3} $, $\text{sRange}_2 = \text{rgbRange} L_2(\theta) $  and $\text{sRange}_3 = \text{rgbRange} L_3(\theta)$.

\begin{align}\label{eq:L}
  L_2(\theta) & \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \sin \left(\left(\theta -\frac{\pi }{6}\right) \bmod \frac{\pi }{3}\right) + \sqrt{2} \cos \left(\left(\theta -\frac{\pi }{6}\right) \bmod \frac{\pi }{3}\right) \\
  L_3(\theta) & \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \sin \left(\theta  \bmod \frac{\pi }{3}\right) + \sqrt{2} \cos \left(\theta  \bmod \frac{\pi }{3}\right)
\end{align}

The destination color space is designed with a maximum discretization $dRange$ given by the required data type.

The analysis of the distribution is mathematically stated in a unit, source, and domain range. The maximum gradient of the distribution, when looked at in these terms, must always be greater than or equal to 1. This indicates a focusing of interest around the mean. It's not possible to extract more information than is contained in the source. For this reason, the destination axis may usefully only be shorter than or of equal length to the source axis. In terms of the machine representation, this indicates that the destination data type may be designed to contain a smaller range of values. The question for the rotational transformation is whether the rotated axis should be rescaled with the associated loss of information or not. We can now write an algorithm which determines the necessary scaling for the axes, and whether truncation of the extreme values is significant.

The length of the axis after rescaling should be whichever is the shorter of

\begin{equation}\label{eq:RescaleAxis}
\min\left\{ \frac{\text{rgbRange} L(\theta)}{dRange} \Lambda(\mu,\sigma) , L(\theta) \right\}
\end{equation}

The condition for rescaling the axis is

\begin{equation}\label{eq:RescaleAxisCondition}
\frac{dRange}{\text{rgbRange} L(\theta) \Lambda(\mu,\sigma)} \le 1
\end{equation}

We can now re-formulate the transformation matrix in three different ways.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:Rotation}
 R_{xyz}(\theta) = \left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
 \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \\
 -\frac{\cos (\theta )}{\sqrt{6}}-\frac{\sin (\theta )}{\sqrt{2}} &
 \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \cos (\theta ) &
 \frac{\sin (\theta )}{\sqrt{2}}-\frac{\cos (\theta )}{\sqrt{6}} \\
 \frac{\sin (\theta )}{\sqrt{6}}-\frac{\cos (\theta )}{\sqrt{2}} &
 -\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \sin (\theta ) &
 \frac{\cos (\theta )}{\sqrt{2}}+\frac{\sin (\theta )}{\sqrt{6}} \\
\end{array}
\right)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:RequestedComprerssion}
\kappa = \frac{\text{rgbRange} }{dRange}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:CompressedRotation}
 \widetilde{R}_{xyz}(\theta,\mathbf{\mu},\mathbf{\sigma}) =
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
 1  \\
 \kappa \Lambda(\mu_2,\sigma_2) \\
 \kappa \Lambda(\mu_3,\sigma_3) \\
\end{array}
\right)
\bigotimes
R_{xyz}(\theta)
\end{equation}

\begin{gather*}
  \widetilde{\theta} = \theta  \bmod \frac{\pi }{3} \\
\widetilde{\vartheta} = \left(\theta +\frac{\pi }{6}\right) \bmod \frac{\pi }{3}
\end{gather*}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:NormRxyz2}
 \overline{R}_{xyz}(\theta) =
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
 1  \\
 \frac{1}{3 \cos \left(\widetilde{\vartheta}\right)+\sqrt{3} \sin \left(\widetilde{\vartheta}\right)} \\
 \frac{1}{3 \cos \left(\widetilde{\theta}\right)+\sqrt{3} \sin \left(\widetilde{\theta}\right)}  \\
\end{array}
\right)

\section{Setting up the 2-Channel Representation}\label{sec:SettingUp2-ChannelRepresentation}

For all computer vision tasks, the most significant influence on the required processing power is the number of channels. This is true even if the total information spread amongst the channels is less than the information contained in a single channel. Partly, this is due to the way that sequential processors operate; there is little difference between processing two 8-bit numbers and two 16-bit numbers on modern 64-bit processors. In contrast, processing a set of three related numbers is significantly more demanding; not only do the numbers have to be loaded into the processor sequentially, but the correlation between the numbers has to be taken into account. So, it is highly desirable to reduce the number of channels necessary for any further processing. The challenge is to compress all the relevant information for the desired subsequent processing into as few channels as possible.

It is not possible to compress all the information in such a way that it is appropriate for every computer vision application. It is, however, possible to tailor a compressing algorithm for a particular application.

The image captured by a CCD camera is designed to fool the human eye. In physical reality, light reaching the sensor spans full spectral range. In the human eye --- and in the camera --- the diversity of chromatic information is lost by representing the spectrum as a combination of three chromatic Gaussians, as can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:spectrum}.

\begin{figure}[h!]

Human skin is made up of two layers, each with its own optical properties: the surface layer --- the "epidermis" --- and the "dermis," the vascular structure underneath in which the blood vessels, lymphatic vessels and other such fibroblast structures can be found (~\cite{Stamatas2004}). The molecules which make up these layers make an important contribution to skin color. The most significant of these are melanin --- which is found in the epidermis --- and oxy-hemoglobin and deoxy-hemoglobin --- both of which reside in the dermis. Melanin is the main spectral absorber in the epidermis and the greatest contributor to the visual perception of surface skin color; it features a monotonic increase toward short wavelengths on its spectral absorption curve in the visible, approaching linear in the region 600-750 nm (~\cite{Stamatas2004,Kollias1995}). Oxy-hemoglobin and deoxy-hemoglobin are actually different states of the same molecule -- hemoglobin -- which is found in the dermal blood supply. The molecule's chromophoric state is dependent upon whether it is delivering oxygen molecules to the tissues; it exists as oxy-hemoglobin if it is delivering oxygen and deoxy-hemoglobin if it isn't. The redness of skin in the areas where hemoglobin is found is due to the molecule's absorption of incident light (~\cite{Kollias1995}). It should be noted that each form of hemoglobin has its own characteristic absorption profile; oxy-hemoglobin's maxima on the absorption curve can be found at 415, 540 and 577 nm, whereas deoxy-hemoglobin's are located at 430 and 555 nm.

Seeing as the chromophores' absorption characteristics are expressed as wavelengths, it should be possible to turn a wavelength into a point in a color space. The absorption spectra is a complete description of the material. As such, it can be used to show what the material would look like under any lighting condition. The white light spectrum as perceived by the human eye can be represented using RGB Gaussian waveforms by turning the absorption spectra into a scattering spectra and representing it in terms of the RGB Gaussians. Through the use of an additive process based on Grassman's law, which states that, if the sample color is a combination of two monochromatic colors, then the value found by the observer for each monochromatic base color from the sample color will be the sum of each sample base color of the two monochromatic colors observed separately, we can find points in the R, G and B channels in the RGB color space for the three chromaphores (~\cite{MIHAI2007}).

The equivalent RGB points for the colors of the absorption peaks can be calculated as follows:

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{cc}
 \{0.6\, -0.0136667 (\lambda -380),0,0.02 (\lambda -380)+0.39\} & \lambda \geq 380.\land \lambda \leq 410. \\
 \{0.19\, -0.00633333 (\lambda -410),0,1\} & \lambda \geq 410.\land \lambda \leq 440. \\
 \left\{0,\frac{\lambda -490}{50}+1,1\right\} & \lambda \geq 440.\land \lambda \leq 490. \\
 \left\{0,1,\frac{510-\lambda }{20}\right\} & \lambda \geq 490.\land \lambda \leq 510. \\
 \left\{\frac{\lambda -580}{70}+1,1,0\right\} & \lambda \geq 510.\land \lambda \leq 580. \\
 \left\{1,\frac{640-\lambda }{60},0\right\} & \lambda \geq 580.\land \lambda \leq 640. \\
 \{1,0,0\} & \lambda \geq 640.\land \lambda \leq 700. \\
 \{0.008125 (780-\lambda )+0.35,0,0\} & \lambda \geq 700.\land \lambda \leq 780. \\
\end{array}
 \\
\end{equation}

If the respective color is shined on a molecule with these properties, it will absorb them. To convert this into a scattering spectrum, spectrum of the incident light must be taken, subtracting the amount that is absorbed. Assuming a uniform line, the process is not unlike flipping the waveform on its Y axis.

The scattering spectra needs to be represented in this three-function Gaussian basis:

We will take the maximum values of these and make a quick transform of the scattering spectra, giving a color value for the molecules and their relative positions in the space. We have a function for the light source, but we will make the crude assumption of an equal amount of all wavelengths. This is sufficient for the purposes of this project.
