I would like to express my deepest thanks to my supervisor, Prof. Roberto Cipolla, and my advisor, Dr. Joan Lasenby, for their guidance and support over the past two years as I was learning the metaphorical computer vision ropes; my colleague and friend Dr. Vijay Badrinarayanan, who was always around to offer advice, suggestions or simply a kind word when I was down. Most importantly, I woud like to acknowledge my wonderful family and friends in Saudi, the states and, especially my little sisters
