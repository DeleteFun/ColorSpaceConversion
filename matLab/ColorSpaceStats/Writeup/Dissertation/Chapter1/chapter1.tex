Initially, this project was intended to be focused on skin detection and feature recognition for the potential application of hand tracking and posture prediction. However, it was quickly noticed that many authors were sticking to the RGB space, which suffers from disadvantages due to changes in lighting affecting the results. It was also noted that there seemed to be some significant disagreement over the methodology behind using a skin model. It appears that the reason many authors avoided luminosity-oriented color spaces was down to the computational intensity of performing the transform, the loss of information, and what seems like a rather perplexing issue to do with white-out, black-out and camera calibration. After reading over the literature, it was decided that two of these three issues were soluble, and the third was worthy of investigation.
